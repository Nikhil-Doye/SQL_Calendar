# SQL Advent Challenge: 24 Days of SQL

Welcome to the SQL Advent Challenge! This repository contains 24 SQL questions, one for each day leading up to Christmas, designed to test and improve SQL skills.

## How It Works

- Each day has its own folder (e.g., `day-01/`) containing:

  - The question (`question.md`)
  - The solution (`solution.sql`)

- All datasets are embedded directly within the `question.md` files.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder for the day you're working on (e.g., `day-05/`).
2. Read the question in `question.md`.
3. Try solving it at SQLCalendar(https://www.sqlcalendar.com/app/advent-calendar).
4. Compare your solution with the provided `solution.sql`.
